Requirements
============

* Python version 2.4 or later
* SQLAlchemy version 0.6 or later (older versions might work but have not been tested)
* DB-API drivers for whatever DBMS you are going to use (e.g. sqlite)

CentOS packages: python-sqlite sqlite-devel gcc
Debian/Ubuntu packages: python-sqlalchemy python-pysqlite2
SLES 10: python-devel sqlite-devel

Installation
============

1. Unpack the tarball somewhere
2. Install all the required software packages
3. Run the install script:

	# python setup.py install

Configuration
=============

1. Create a new directory that is going to hold both the configuration files
   as well as the database (assuming you're using sqlite).

	$ mkdir /var/lib/netways_grapher

2. Copy the example config files:

	$ cp docs/conf/* /var/lib/netways_grapher

3. Start the grapher daemon (working dir _must_ be the directory you just created):

	$ cd /var/lib/netways_grapher
	$ grapher-daemon

(You might want to do this in a screen session - or using nohup).

4. You can now either import an existing Grapher V2 database using 'grapher-importv2'
   or import raw Nagios/Icinga perfdata logs using the 'grapher-file-collector' script. The
   file collector script expects its input on stdin.
