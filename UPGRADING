inGraph Upgrade Guide

INTRODUCTION
------------
This document describes how to update your inGraph setup.
See README for instructions on installing for the first time.

UPGRADING FROM 1.0 TO 1.0.1
---------------------------
1. Stop Daemons
    $ service ingraph-collector stop
    $ service ingraph stop

2. Install inGraph as you did with version 1.0. For instructions please see the
file called INSTALL. Setup will not overwrite existing configuration files.
However initscripts will be replaced.

3. If you changed any of the graph templates they got backuped with the '~'
(tilde) suffix before getting overwritten. Currently there is no support to
distinguish between distributed and user templates. Hence you have to merge your
changes back in.

4. Sart Daemons
