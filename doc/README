inGraph

What is it?
-----------
inGraph is a flexible, open source charting tool for Icinga and Nagios. The
Python backend collects performance data provided by check plugins and stores
them in a relational database. For displaying graphs inGraph provides a
standalone web interface and an icinga-web integration module both written in PHP
and JavaScript. Furthermore using the check_ingraph plugin you can monitor trends for
any of your checks which provide performance data. For example you can configure
a check to notify you if the load for your server is increasing unexpectedly.
